# MCH-mocmaster

This repository is meant to enhance the mcheli minecraft mod far beyond what it is capable of. Any and all help would be resourceful. This is a derivative of the source code found [[here](https://github.com/RagexPrince683/MCH-defaultmaster)] 


FAQ: Why is it called mocmaster if it's for mcheli overdrive?
This repository was originally called mocmaster after Moc the guy who showed me the original mcheli backend code, since then I've broken a few repos and have resorted to this being my main Mcheli-Overdrive repository.
